        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hey, I'm Jordan. I'm studying with Command Shift in the hopes of securing my dream job in the tech industry.</p>
        <p>I got into code the usual way, with free online resources. I studied with FreeCodeCamp for a while, and tried my hand at Harvard's CS50 course. </p>
